    "PCA is a method of reassigning the dimensions used to describe and visualise a data set in such a way that the variation is more emphasised than before. It is generally used to bring out the strongest patterns in de data, and often to reduce the amount of dimensions since the new assignment will often leave (at least) one dimension with very little variation, so it can be removed without much consequence. The latter is very useful when some data analysis techniques can be used only on data sets with less dimensions than the pre-PCA set. However on small data sets we might lose information that we wanted to keep when using PCA.\n",

    "Another drawback of PCA is that we rely on the fact that there is some linear correlation, i.e. if the data set is a circle we will not get anything useful from applying PCA. Also because we try to find orthogonal attributes, sometimes this means we will not find the most variance as the attributes with the most variance are not always orthogonal.\n",

For example: **Z** = **Y\\*V[:,0]** would also yield the projection of the data onto the first PC.\n",

    "Eigenvalue decomposition is a singular value decomposition, but not necessarily vice versa. Both rely on eigenvectors. However only square matrices have eigenvectors: in the case of EVD this means it can only be applied to square matrices, and in the case of SVD this means instead of taking the eigenvalues of (possibly non-square) matrix $A$, we take the eigenvalues of $A^TA$. The eigenvectors that correspond to these eigenvalues are the singular vectors of $A$.\n",
