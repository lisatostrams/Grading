Various methods exist, of which the use of the Python library Pandas is arguably one of the easiest for the purpose of Data Mining.\n",

    "The data used in this exercise is based on data from a chemical sensor obtained from the NanoNose project[1]. The data contains 8 sensors, named by the letters A-H, measuring the concentration of Water, Ethanol, Acetone, Heptane and Pentanol injected into a small gas chamber. The data will be represented in matrix form such that each column contains the 8 sensor measurements (i.e., sensor A-H) of the various compounds injected into the gas chamber.\n",
