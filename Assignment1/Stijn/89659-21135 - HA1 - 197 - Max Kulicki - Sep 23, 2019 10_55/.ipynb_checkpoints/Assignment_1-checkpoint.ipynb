    "PCA is an algorithm which can help reduce the dimensionality of data. It identifies the linear directions which are responsile for most of the variance. It first mean centers the data, then, to find the principal component, it looks for a line which minimizes the distance between the data points and their projections onto that line. After that, we can perform the operation again by looking for a line perpendicular to the first component that fits the data best. We can identify as many principal components as there are data dimensions, each next one being less important for explaining the data variance. Then we can compress the data by discarding the least important components. This way, we reduce the number of dimensions and do not lose much information. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is limited by the fact that it is restricted to linear components. If there are hidden linear correlations in the data, it can find them, but it's not necessarily the case, for example with data that forms a spiral or a circle. It is also highly dependent on normalization of the data. If you change the scale of any variable, you will get different PCA results.\n",

    "The given data **X** must first be mean centered. This can be easily done by calculating a row vector **μ** containing the mean values of each attribute. Then you can subtract **μ** from **X** (**Y** = **X** - **μ**, where **μ** is subtracted from every row.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the Singular Value Decomposition (or SVD) of **Y**, the now mean centered data, can be calculated. **Y** = **USV**<sup>T</sup>. In practice, this is often done using the `numpy.linalg.svd()` function.\n",

    "Using SVD on **Y** yields 3 matrices **U**, **S** and **V**<sup>T</sup>. These are used to project the data onto specific Principal Components (PCs). \n",
    "\n",
    "The entire dataset can be projected onto the Principal Components by multiplying **Z** = **Y\\*V**, where **Z** indicates the projected data, and **Z[:,0]** indicates the data projected onto the first PC. Alternatively, one could project onto just a subset of all the PCs by indexing in the multiplication. For example: **Z** = **Y\\*V[:,0]** would also yield the projection of the data onto the first PC.\n",
