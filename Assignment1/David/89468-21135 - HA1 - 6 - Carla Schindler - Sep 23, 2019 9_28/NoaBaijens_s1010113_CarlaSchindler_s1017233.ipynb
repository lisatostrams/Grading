    "The objective is to get acquainted with the Python language, with emphasis on its scientific and numerical extensions, how data can be imported from other data sources, the linear algebra basics that are needed for this course, visualization using principal component analysis (PCA) and the concept of similarity. Upon completing this exercise it is expected that you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how data can be represented as vectors and matrices in numerical Python (NumPy).\n",
    "- Can apply and interpret principal component analysis (PCA) for data visualization.\n",
    "- Understand the various measures of similarity such as Jaccard and Cosine similarity and apply similarity measures to query for similar observations.\n",

It tries to find a meaningful way to flatten the data by focusing on the things that are different between dimensions. Dimensions witht he largest variation between cells will have the most influence on the principal components (PCs). \n",
    "The first PC captures the most variation in the data, the 2nd PC, orthogonal to the principal direction captures the second most variation etc. etc. You can get an X/Y graph with those first two PCs. (source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UVHneBUBW0) \n",

PCA also assumes that the principle components are orthogonal and low variance axes are always treated as noise, while they may not be.

When the data is centered on the origin, we can try to fit a line to it. It is easier to do this from the origin because it is easier to calculate the distance from a data point to the origin.
