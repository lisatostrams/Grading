To flatten $y$, you can use `y.ravel()`, which unravels matrices into a 1d array. Attribute names and class names are stored in the attributeNames and classNames objects, which contain arrays, of which the first element contains the names. To get the names from those arrays, you can use list comprehension or for-loops. For more on list comprehension, check https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-list-comprehensions-in-python-3. For example, if you have an larger array containing nested arrays of which you want the first element, you can try `new_array = [nested_array[0] for nested_array in larger_array]`.*\n",
