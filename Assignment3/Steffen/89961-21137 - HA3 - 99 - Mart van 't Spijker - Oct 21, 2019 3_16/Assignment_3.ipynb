Create data matrix $X$, class vector $y$, and the lists $attributeNames$ and $classNames$ with the data provided in the `wine.mat` file.

    "*The object in wine.mat is a dictionary. The attributes are stored in matrix $X$, the class in vector $y$. $y$ is shaped as an array containing single element arrays. To flatten $y$, you can use `y.ravel()`, which unravels matrices into a 1d array. Attribute names and class names are stored in the attributeNames and classNames objects, which contain arrays, of which the first element contains the names. To get the names from those arrays, you can use list comprehension or for-loops. For more on list comprehension, check https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-list-comprehensions-in-python-3. For example, if you have an larger array containing nested arrays of which you want the first element, you can try `new_array = [nested_array[0] for nested_array in larger_array]`.*\n",

    "(1.5 pts) Repeat the exercise above, using 10-fold cross-validation. K-fold cross-validation works by splitting X into K partitions of equal length. Then in each fold, you choose K-1 partitions as the training set and the remaining partition as the test set. Every partition gets a turn being a test set. For a very nice simple explanation of how (and why) K-fold works, check out http://www.dummies.com/programming/big-data/data-science/resorting-cross-validation-machine-learning/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For each fold, fit a decision tree on the training set and evaluate its performance on the test set. Finally, compute the average classification errors on the test- and training sets across the 10 cross-validation folds and plot them as a function of the tree depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "** hints: **\n",
    "*This time the `KFold()` function from the module `sklearn.model_selection` can be used to partition the data into the 10 training and test partitions. Check out http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#k-fold for an example of how to acces the indices for the training set and the test set in each fold. Those indices can then be used to create the training and test set, e.g. `X_train = X[train_indices]`*\n",

    " ## 3.3 ROC curves, AUC scores, and the sign test\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will use ROC curves and the sign test to compare classifiers. Study the lecture slides and the paper 'ROC Graphs: Notes and Practical Considerations for Researchers' by Tom Fawcett included with the homework assignment (ROC101.pdf). It describes all you need to know (and much, much more..) about ROC curves. The method explained for computing the area under the curve is unnecessarily complicated. A simpler formula is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\mbox{AUC} = {1 \\over m n} \\sum_{i=1}^m \\sum_{j=1}^n \\mathbf{\\large 1}_{p_i > p_j} \\: .\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "Here $i$ runs over all $m$ data points with true label 1, and $j$ runs over all $n$ data points with true label $0$; $p_i$ and $p_j$ denote the probability score assigned by the classifier to data point $i$ and $j$, respectively. $\\mathbf{\\large 1}$ is the indicator function: it outputs $1$ if the condition (here $p_i > p_j$) is satisfied and $0$ otherwise. *Simply put: this formula computes how often the probability of a data point with true label 1 is higher than the probability of data points with true label 0. This is then divided by the total number of comparisons between probabilities.*\n",

    "Imagine you have a lucky coin, that you are certain does not result in heads 50% of the times you flip it. However, you friend (lets call him *zero_hypothesis*) claims that your coin is just like his random coin. To verify whether this is true, you decide to compare the performance (you are a scientist after all) of your lucky coin resulting in heads to the performance of his random coin resulting in heads with a sign test. How do you do this?\n",

It was determined that if one of you flipped head while the other didn't, that person won the bet, and the other person lost. If you both got the same outcome, neither of you won. 1 stands for head, and 0 for tails. These were your results:"
